          Why Ammonia?
        </h2>
        <p>
        Ammonia (NH₃) stands out as one of the most promising energy carriers of the future due to its unique properties, versatility, and existing infrastructure. While many renewable energy solutions focus on electricity generation, ammonia addresses the critical need for a sustainable, high-density energy storage medium and transportable fuel, especially in sectors that are difficult to electrify. Here are the key reasons why ammonia is increasingly considered an ideal candidate for clean energy:
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "10px", color: "#000" }}>
        1. Carbon-Free Combustion
      </h3>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, or diesel, ammonia combusts without releasing any carbon dioxide (CO₂), the primary contributor to global warming. When burned, ammonia decomposes into nitrogen (N₂) and water vapor (H₂O), both of which are environmentally benign. This makes ammonia an excellent candidate for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in industries such as shipping, power generation, and heavy manufacturing, where fossil fuels are currently dominant.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "10px", color: "#000" }}>
