          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
        Enzymes are nature’s catalysts, facilitating vital biochemical reactions in living organisms. They have also proven indispensable in numerous industries, from pharmaceuticals and food processing to biofuels and environmental remediation. However, natural enzymes come with significant limitations, such as sensitivity to environmental conditions, high production costs, and a lack of scalability. Enter artificial enzymes—synthetic molecules designed to replicate and often surpass the catalytic functions of natural enzymes. These engineered catalysts are paving the way for a new era of industrial innovation, offering unmatched efficiency, versatility, and sustainability.

          What Are Artificial Enzymes?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Artificial enzymes are synthetic molecules designed to replicate the catalytic functions of natural enzymes. They can be composed of small organic molecules, polymers, or inorganic complexes. These synthetic catalysts are created to overcome the limitations of natural enzymes, such as narrow operational ranges, high production costs, and degradation under industrial conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike natural enzymes, artificial enzymes can be tailored to specific applications, offering precise control over their catalytic properties. This flexibility has enabled their application across a wide range of industries, including pharmaceuticals, food processing, biofuels, and environmental remediation.
