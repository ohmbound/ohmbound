          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          The field of chemistry has long sought to innovate processes that are
          not only efficient but also environmentally sustainable. One of the
          most revolutionary concepts in this domain is atom economy, which
          focuses on maximizing the utilization of all reactant atoms in a
          chemical process. Coined by Barry Trost in 1991, atom economy is now a
          cornerstone of green chemistry, guiding researchers and industries
          toward waste-free chemical synthesis. This article delves into the
          principles, applications, and potential of atom-economy reactions in
          modern chemistry.

          What Is Atom Economy?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Atom economy refers to the efficiency of a chemical reaction in terms
          of how well it incorporates all the atoms of the reactants into the
          final product. Unlike traditional measures of reaction efficiency that
          focus solely on yield, atom economy evaluates the reaction holistically,
          considering the fate of every atom involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mathematical expression for atom economy is:
        </p>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "center", fontStyle: "italic", margin: "10px 0" }}>
          Atom Economy (%) = (Molecular Weight of Desired Product รท Sum of Molecular
          Weights of All Reactants) ร 100
        </p>
        <p>
          A reaction with high atom economy ensures minimal waste generation, making
          it both cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

          Principles of Atom Economy
        </h2>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Minimizing Byproducts:</strong> Reactions should be designed to
            minimize or eliminate the formation of unwanted byproducts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Efficient Use of Atoms:</strong> All reactant atoms should ideally
            end up in the final product.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choice of Reagents:</strong> Reagents and catalysts should be
            selected to maximize atom incorporation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Simplicity:</strong> Simplifying reaction pathways can lead to
            higher atom economy and reduce resource consumption.

          Examples of Atom-Economy Reactions
        </h2>
        <p>
          Atom-economy principles can be observed in several types of chemical
          reactions:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Addition Reactions:</strong> In addition reactions, all reactant
            atoms are incorporated into the product, leading to 100% atom economy.
            For example, the addition of hydrogen bromide to ethene to form bromoethane.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Elimination Reactions:</strong> Elimination reactions often produce
            byproducts, such as water or hydrogen. However, designing catalysts that
            suppress side reactions can improve atom economy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cross-Coupling Reactions:</strong> These reactions are widely used
            in pharmaceuticals and materials science. Palladium-catalyzed Suzuki
            coupling is a prime example of a high atom-economy reaction.
