          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          Air quality is a critical factor affecting human health and
          environmental sustainability. With increasing urbanization and
          industrial activity, monitoring air pollution in real time has become
          more important than ever. Enter chemiresistive sensors—small,
          cost-effective, and highly sensitive devices designed to detect and
          measure air pollutants at unprecedented levels of precision. These
          sensors have revolutionized the field of air quality monitoring,
          enabling real-time data collection and analysis to tackle pollution
          more effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article explores the science behind chemiresistive sensors, their
          applications, and their role in revolutionizing real-time air quality
          monitoring systems.

          What Are Chemiresistive Sensors?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Chemiresistive sensors are a type of gas sensor that operate by
          detecting changes in electrical resistance when exposed to specific
          gases. These sensors are typically composed of a sensitive material,
          such as metal oxides, polymers, or nanomaterials, that interacts with
          target gas molecules. When a gas is adsorbed onto the sensor's
          surface, it induces a chemical reaction that alters the material's
          electrical properties, providing a measurable signal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The working principle of chemiresistive sensors is straightforward yet
          highly effective, making them ideal for detecting a wide range of
          pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), carbon monoxide (CO),
          ozone (O₃), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

          How Chemiresistive Sensors Work
        </h2>
        <p>
          The core functionality of a chemiresistive sensor lies in its
          interaction with gas molecules:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Adsorption:</strong> When gas molecules come into contact
            with the sensor's surface, they are adsorbed onto the sensitive
            material.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chemical Reaction:</strong> The adsorbed molecules react
            with the surface material, leading to a transfer of charge between
            the gas and the sensor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resistance Change:</strong> This charge transfer causes a
            change in the material's electrical resistance, which is detected
            and quantified by the sensor's electronic circuitry.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By analyzing these resistance changes, the concentration of specific
          gases in the air can be determined with high accuracy.
