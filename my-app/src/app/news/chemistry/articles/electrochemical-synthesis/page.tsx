          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          In the pursuit of greener and more sustainable chemistry, 
          electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a promising tool. 
          By using electricity to drive chemical reactions, this 
          method eliminates the need for traditional chemical reagents, 
          reducing waste and environmental harm. This article delves 
          into the principles, advantages, and applications of 
          electrochemical synthesis, as well as the challenges and 
          future directions in this exciting field.

          What is Electrochemical Synthesis?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Electrochemical synthesis, also known as electrosynthesis, 
          is a process where electrical energy is used to drive chemical 
          transformations. At its core, this technique involves the 
          use of an anode (positive electrode) and a cathode (negative 
          electrode) to induce oxidation and reduction reactions, 
          respectively. This process allows for precise control over 
          reaction conditions, enabling cleaner and more selective 
          chemical processes.
