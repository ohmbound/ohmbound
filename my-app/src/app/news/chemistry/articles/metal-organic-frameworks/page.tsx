          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are an extraordinary class of materials that have captured the attention of scientists and engineers across a wide range of fields. Known for their unparalleled porosity and modularity, MOFs combine the precision of chemistry with the creativity of architecture. These hybrid materials are made up of metal nodes connected by organic linkers, forming a highly tunable, lattice-like structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          MOFs are revolutionizing industries by offering solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our time, including energy storage, gas capture, catalysis, and drug delivery. This article delves into the fundamentals, applications, and future potential of these advanced materials.

          What Are Metal-Organic Frameworks?
        </h2>
        <p>
          MOFs are crystalline materials composed of two primary components: metal ions or clusters (the "nodes") and organic molecules (the "linkers"). The interaction between these components creates a highly ordered, three-dimensional structure with uniform pores and channels. These pores, which can be as large as 90% of the material's volume, make MOFs some of the most porous materials known to science.
        </p>
        <p>
          The modularity of MOFs allows scientists to fine-tune their properties by selecting different metal ions and linkers. This "building block" approach gives MOFs incredible versatility, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.

          Challenges in MOF Development
        </h2>
        <p>
          Despite their promise, MOFs face several challenges:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Cost of Production:</strong> Synthesizing MOFs can be expensive, particularly for large-scale applications.

          <li>
            <strong>Scalability:</strong> While MOFs show excellent lab-scale performance, scaling up production while maintaining quality is a significant challenge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stability:</strong> Some MOFs are prone to degradation in humid or reactive environments, limiting their practical use.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Addressing these challenges requires advances in material science, manufacturing processes, and computational modeling to design more robust and cost-effective MOFs.
