          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          As the world moves toward a clean energy future, hydrogen is emerging as a critical component of sustainable energy systems. Hydrogen is versatile, efficient, and produces zero emissions when used as a fuel. Among the many methods of hydrogen production, water splitting is one of the most promising. By using electricity to separate water (H₂O) into hydrogen (H₂) and oxygen (O₂), water splitting offers a clean and renewable way to produce hydrogen without reliance on fossil fuels.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article delves into the science of water splitting, its potential to revolutionize energy systems, and the challenges that lie ahead.

          What Is Water Splitting?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Water splitting is a chemical process that uses energy to break the bonds of water molecules, separating them into their constituent hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The reaction can be represented as:
        </p>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold" }}>
          2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂
        </p>
        <p>
          The process requires an input of energy, which is typically supplied in the form of electricity. When renewable energy sources like solar, wind, or hydropower are used, the hydrogen produced is considered "green hydrogen," making it a truly sustainable fuel source.

          Methods of Water Splitting
        </h2>
        <p>
          Several methods are used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, each with its own advantages and challenges:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Electrolysis:</strong> The most common method, electrolysis, uses an electric current to drive the water-splitting reaction. Electrolyzers, the devices used for this process, typically consist of an anode (where oxygen is formed), a cathode (where hydrogen is formed), and an electrolyte that conducts ions between the two electrodes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting:</strong> This method uses sunlight to directly drive the chemical reaction. Specialized photoelectrodes made of materials like titanium dioxide or perovskites absorb sunlight and generate the energy needed to split water.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Thermochemical Water Splitting:</strong> In this approach, high temperatures (usually above 500°C) from concentrated solar power or nuclear energy are used to break the water molecules. This method is efficient but requires advanced materials that can withstand extreme conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Biological Water Splitting:</strong> Certain microorganisms, such as algae and cyanobacteria, can produce hydrogen through biological processes under specific conditions. While still in the experimental stage, this method has potential for sustainable hydrogen production.
          </li>
        </ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Industry:</strong> Hydrogen is used in industrial processes such as ammonia production, steel manufacturing, and refining, helping to reduce emissions in these traditionally high-carbon sectors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Power Generation:</strong> Hydrogen can be burned in turbines or fuel cells to generate electricity, producing only water as a byproduct.
