          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          The exponential growth of electronic devices has brought significant
          advancements in technology but has also led to a growing environmental
          challenge: electronic waste (e-waste). With millions of tons of
          electronic devices discarded every year, finding sustainable
          alternatives has become a pressing concern. Enter biodegradable
          electronicsâ€”a groundbreaking innovation aimed at reducing the
          environmental impact of our tech-dependent world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biodegradable electronics use materials that can naturally decompose
          over time, leaving minimal or no harmful residues. From medical
          implants that dissolve after use to eco-friendly circuit boards,
          these devices represent a revolutionary step toward a greener future.

          What Are Biodegradable Electronics?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Biodegradable electronics are devices designed to perform their
          intended function and then decompose safely into the environment once
          they are no longer needed. Unlike traditional electronics, which are
          made from non-degradable materials like plastics and heavy metals,
          biodegradable electronics rely on sustainable alternatives such as
          cellulose, silk, and polylactic acid (PLA). These materials are
          engineered to break down under specific environmental conditions, such
          as exposure to moisture, heat, or microorganisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core components of biodegradable electronics include:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Biodegradable Substrates:</strong> Materials like paper,
            silk, or bioplastics serve as the base layer for electronic circuits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Eco-Friendly Conductors:</strong> Metals like magnesium or
            zinc, which naturally degrade, replace traditional conductors like
            copper or aluminum.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dissolvable Polymers:</strong> Polymers that break down
            under environmental conditions are used to encapsulate and protect
            electronic components.
          </li>
        </ul>
