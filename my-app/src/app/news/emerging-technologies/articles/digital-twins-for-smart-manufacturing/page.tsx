          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          The rise of Industry 4.0 has brought transformative technologies to
          manufacturing, and digital twins are at the forefront of this
          revolution. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical system,
          product, or process that uses real-time data and simulations to
          optimize operations and predict outcomes. In the world of smart
          manufacturing, digital twins are enabling unprecedented levels of
          efficiency, precision, and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          By bridging the physical and digital worlds, digital twins provide
          manufacturers with actionable insights to improve production, reduce
          costs, and enhance product quality. This article explores the concept,
          applications, and future potential of digital twins in smart
          manufacturing.

          What Are Digital Twins?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A digital twin is a dynamic digital representation of a physical
          object, system, or process. It integrates data from sensors, IoT
          devices, and advanced analytics to create a real-time virtual model.
          This model evolves alongside its physical counterpart, continuously
          reflecting changes, conditions, and performance metrics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Digital twins enable a two-way flow of information. They not only
          monitor and simulate the physical system but also provide predictive
          insights and recommend optimizations. In manufacturing, this means
          that factories can detect potential issues, experiment with design
          changes, and streamline operationsâ€”all within a virtual environment.
