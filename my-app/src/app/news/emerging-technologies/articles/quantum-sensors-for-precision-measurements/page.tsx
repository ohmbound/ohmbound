          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          Quantum sensors represent the cutting edge of measurement technology,
          utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics to achieve unprecedented
          levels of precision. Unlike classical sensors, which rely on
          macroscopic phenomena, quantum sensors leverage the unique properties
          of quantum states—such as superposition, entanglement, and
          tunneling—to measure physical quantities with extraordinary accuracy.
          These devices are poised to revolutionize fields ranging from
          navigation and healthcare to fundamental physics and Earth sciences.

          What Are Quantum Sensors?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Quantum sensors are devices designed to detect and measure physical
          quantities—such as time, magnetic fields, acceleration, or
          gravitational forces—using quantum phenomena. These sensors exploit
          the sensitivity of quantum states to external influences, making them
          far more precise than their classical counterparts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, atomic clocks are a type of quantum sensor that measure
          time by observing the frequency of radiation absorbed or emitted by
          electrons transitioning between energy levels in atoms. Similarly,
          magnetometers based on quantum principles can detect minuscule
          magnetic fields, enabling applications in medicine, geophysics, and
          even archaeology.

          Principles of Quantum Sensing
        </h2>
        <p>
          Quantum sensors derive their extraordinary precision from several key
          quantum phenomena:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Superposition:</strong> Quantum particles can exist in
            multiple states simultaneously, allowing sensors to process
            information from all possible states, enhancing sensitivity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Entanglement:</strong> Entangled particles share
            information instantaneously, regardless of distance, enabling highly
            correlated measurements that reduce noise and improve accuracy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quantum Tunneling:</strong> The ability of particles to pass
            through barriers allows for unique sensing capabilities in
            applications like nanoscale imaging and materials analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quantum Interference:</strong> The wave-like properties of
            quantum particles enable interference patterns that can be used to
            measure changes in physical parameters with extraordinary precision.
          </li>
