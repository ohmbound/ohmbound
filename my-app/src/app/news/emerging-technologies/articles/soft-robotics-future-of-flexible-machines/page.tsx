          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          Soft robotics is an emerging field at the intersection of engineering,
          material science, and biology, revolutionizing how robots interact
          with their environment. Unlike traditional rigid robots made of
          metal, soft robots are composed of flexible materials like silicone,
          rubber, or gels. These machines mimic the adaptability and
          resilience of natural organisms, enabling them to navigate complex
          terrains, handle delicate objects, and perform tasks that rigid robots
          cannot. As industries and researchers continue to explore this
          cutting-edge technology, soft robotics is paving the way for
          innovative applications in medicine, manufacturing, and more.

          What Are Soft Robots?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Soft robots are robotic systems designed with materials and mechanisms
          that prioritize flexibility, adaptability, and safety. Inspired by
          biological organisms such as octopuses, worms, and human muscles,
          soft robots leverage compliant materials to achieve movements and
          functions that rigid robots cannot replicate. Their soft structures
          allow them to deform, stretch, and adapt to their surroundings,
          making them ideal for tasks that require precision, gentleness, or
          interaction with humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key components of soft robots include actuators, sensors, and
          controllers. Actuators in soft robots are often pneumatic, hydraulic,
          or made of electroactive polymers, enabling smooth and flexible
          movements. Sensors embedded within the robot can detect pressure,
          force, or environmental changes, providing real-time feedback for
          adaptive behavior. Controllers use this feedback to execute
          coordinated and efficient movements.
