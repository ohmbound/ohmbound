          What Are Solid-State Sensors?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Solid-state sensors are devices that detect changes in physical, chemical, or environmental conditions and convert them into measurable electrical signals. Unlike mechanical sensors, which use moving parts, solid-state sensors rely on solid materials such as silicon, gallium arsenide, and piezoelectric crystals to perform their function.
        </p>
        <p>
          These sensors are designed to detect a wide range of variables, including temperature, pressure, light, motion, and chemical composition. Their compact design, high sensitivity, and ability to integrate seamlessly with electronic systems make them a cornerstone of modern robotics.
