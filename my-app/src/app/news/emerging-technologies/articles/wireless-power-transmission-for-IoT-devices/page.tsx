          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized how we interact with
          technology, integrating smart devices into our daily lives. From smart
          homes to industrial automation, IoT devices have become ubiquitous.
          However, powering these devices remains a critical challenge,
          especially in remote or hard-to-reach locations. Enter wireless power
          transmission (WPT), a groundbreaking technology that eliminates the
          need for traditional wired charging and opens new possibilities for
          IoT applications.

          What is Wireless Power Transmission?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Wireless Power Transmission (WPT) refers to the transfer of electrical
          energy from a power source to a device without the use of physical
          wires. This is achieved through various methods, including inductive
          coupling, magnetic resonance, and radio frequency (RF) energy
          transfer. WPT technology enables the charging or powering of devices
          remotely, offering greater flexibility and convenience in device
          design and deployment.

          Why Wireless Power is Crucial for IoT
        </h2>
        <p>
          IoT devices are often deployed in environments where traditional
          charging or wiring is impractical. For example, sensors used in
          agriculture, healthcare wearables, and industrial equipment may need
          to operate continuously without human intervention. Wireless power
          transmission addresses these challenges by providing:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Seamless Operation:</strong> Eliminates downtime for
            recharging or replacing batteries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Allows devices to be placed in
            hard-to-reach or mobile locations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reduced Maintenance:</strong> Minimizes the need for manual
            intervention in replacing or charging batteries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improved Design:</strong> Enables sleeker and more compact
            device designs by removing bulky connectors and ports.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Methods of Wireless Power Transmission
        </h2>
        <p>Several techniques are used to achieve wireless power transmission:</p>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Inductive Coupling:</strong> This method uses a magnetic
            field generated by a coil in the power transmitter to induce a
            current in a coil in the receiving device. It is commonly used in
            wireless charging pads for smartphones and other small devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Magnetic Resonance:</strong> Magnetic resonance enhances
            efficiency by using resonant inductive coupling, which allows energy
            transfer over greater distances compared to inductive coupling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Radio Frequency (RF) Transmission:</strong> RF-based
            systems transmit power using electromagnetic waves. These systems
            are suitable for low-power IoT devices and can work over longer
            distances.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Laser-Based Power Transfer:</strong> Laser beams are used to
            deliver energy to a photovoltaic receiver. While this method is
            efficient, it requires a direct line of sight between the transmitter
            and receiver.
          </li>
