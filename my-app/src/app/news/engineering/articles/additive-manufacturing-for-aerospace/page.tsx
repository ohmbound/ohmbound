          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly referred to as 3D printing, is
          transforming the aerospace industry by enabling the production of
          complex, lightweight, and high-performance components. This
          revolutionary technology uses a layer-by-layer process to build parts
          directly from digital designs, eliminating many of the constraints
          associated with traditional manufacturing methods. From reducing
          material waste to enhancing design flexibility, additive manufacturing
          is paving the way for more efficient and sustainable aerospace
          systems.

          What is Additive Manufacturing?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Additive manufacturing is a process of creating objects by adding
          material layer by layer, guided by a digital 3D model. Unlike
          traditional subtractive manufacturing, which involves cutting or
          drilling material away from a larger block, additive manufacturing
          builds parts from the ground up. This process allows for unparalleled
          precision, complex geometries, and minimal material waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aerospace industry, known for its stringent requirements on
          performance and safety, has embraced additive manufacturing as a way
          to address challenges such as weight reduction, fuel efficiency, and
          design optimization.
