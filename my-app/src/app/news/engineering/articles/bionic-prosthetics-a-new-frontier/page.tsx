          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          Advances in biomedical engineering have paved the way for bionic
          prosthetics, redefining the possibilities for individuals with
          physical disabilities. Unlike traditional prosthetic devices, bionic
          prosthetics incorporate advanced robotics, sensors, and neural
          interfaces to restore functionality, improve quality of life, and
          bridge the gap between human capability and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          From enabling precise motor control to offering sensory feedback,
          bionic prosthetics are more than replacements—they represent a fusion
          of human ingenuity and cutting-edge innovation.

          What Are Bionic Prosthetics?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Bionic prosthetics are highly advanced artificial limbs designed to
          mimic the functionality of natural body parts. These devices integrate
          robotics, microprocessors, and biocompatible materials to enable users
          to perform tasks with precision and ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          A hallmark feature of bionic prosthetics is their ability to interface
          with the user’s nervous system. By detecting electrical signals from
          muscles or nerves, these devices translate neural commands into
          movement, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience. Some
          bionic prosthetics even offer sensory feedback, allowing users to
          "feel" touch, pressure, or temperature through their artificial limbs.
