          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          The construction industry, long reliant on conventional materials like
          steel, concrete, and wood, is now exploring advanced nanotechnology to
          revolutionize infrastructure and building designs. Among these
          cutting-edge materials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have emerged as a
          promising innovation due to their unparalleled strength, flexibility,
          and conductivity. These microscopic cylindrical structures are poised
          to redefine what is possible in construction, offering enhanced

          What Are Carbon Nanotubes?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Carbon nanotubes are nanoscale cylindrical structures composed of
          carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. These tubes can be
          single-walled (SWCNTs) or multi-walled (MWCNTs), with diameters
          ranging from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers. Despite their
          tiny size, CNTs are incredibly strongâ€”100 times stronger than steel
          at one-sixth the weight. Additionally, they possess excellent thermal
          and electrical conductivity, making them versatile for various
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discovered in the early 1990s, CNTs have since been studied for use in
          fields ranging from electronics to medicine. In construction, their
          unique properties open the door to innovations that could address
          long-standing challenges like structural degradation and material
          inefficiency.
