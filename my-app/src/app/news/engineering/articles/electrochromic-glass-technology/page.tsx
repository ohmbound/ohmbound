          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          Electrochromic glass, often referred to as “smart glass,” is a
          groundbreaking technology that allows windows to switch between
          transparent and opaque states with the flick of a switch. This
          innovative material is revolutionizing industries like construction,
          automotive, and aerospace by offering energy efficiency,
          user-controlled privacy, and aesthetic appeal. By dynamically
          controlling the amount of light and heat passing through a window,
          electrochromic glass is paving the way for a more sustainable and
          comfortable future.

          What Is Electrochromic Glass?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Electrochromic glass is a type of smart material that changes its
          optical properties in response to an applied electric voltage. The
          technology works by utilizing layers of electrochromic materials,
          which modulate their transparency and coloration when electrically
          charged. This process is reversible, meaning the glass can be
          switched back and forth between states as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The glass typically consists of five key layers: two transparent
          conductive layers, two electrochromic layers, and an electrolyte
          layer sandwiched between them. When voltage is applied, ions move
          within the electrolyte layer, causing the electrochromic material to
          change its light-absorbing properties. This mechanism allows for
          precise control over light and heat transmission.
