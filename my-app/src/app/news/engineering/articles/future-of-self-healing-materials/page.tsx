          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          Imagine a world where cracked screens, damaged infrastructure, or
          scratched surfaces could repair themselves without any external
          intervention. This is not science fiction—it’s the promise of
          self-healing materials. These innovative materials are engineered to
          autonomously repair damage, extending the lifespan of products,
          reducing waste, and revolutionizing industries ranging from
          construction to healthcare. As the demand for sustainable and durable
          materials grows, self-healing materials represent a groundbreaking
          leap toward a more resilient future.

          What Are Self-Healing Materials?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Self-healing materials are advanced composites that can detect damage
          and initiate repair processes on their own. These materials are
          inspired by biological systems, such as human skin, which can heal
          after injury. Self-healing mechanisms can be activated through
          external stimuli like heat, light, or moisture, or they can operate
          autonomously without any external input.
        </p>
        <p>
          The science behind self-healing materials relies on a variety of
          techniques, including microencapsulation, reversible chemical bonds,
          and dynamic polymer networks. These approaches allow the material to
          "heal" cracks, fractures, or surface damage, restoring its structural
          integrity and functionality.

          How Do Self-Healing Materials Work?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The self-healing process can be achieved through several mechanisms:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Microencapsulation:</strong> Microcapsules containing
            healing agents, such as resins or adhesives, are embedded within the
            material. When a crack occurs, these capsules break open, releasing
            the healing agent to seal the crack.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reversible Chemical Bonds:</strong> Certain materials are
            designed with reversible chemical bonds that can break and reform in
            response to external stimuli like heat or UV light, enabling
            self-repair.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dynamic Polymer Networks:</strong> Polymers with dynamic
            covalent or hydrogen bonds can "flow" to fill gaps and restore
            strength after damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Biological Inspiration:</strong> Some materials mimic
            natural healing processes by utilizing chemical reactions triggered
            by environmental factors, such as moisture or oxygen.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
