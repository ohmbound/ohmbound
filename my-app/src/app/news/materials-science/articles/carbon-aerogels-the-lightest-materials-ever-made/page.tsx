          What Are Carbon Aerogels?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Carbon aerogels are a subset of aerogels, a class of highly porous,
          ultralight materials derived from gels in which the liquid component
          has been replaced with air. These aerogels are made primarily of
          carbon and are often produced by carbonizing organic precursors such
          as resorcinol-formaldehyde or polyacrylonitrile-based gels.
        </p>
        <p>
          The resulting structure is a network of interconnected carbon
          nanoparticles, forming a material with an incredibly high surface
          area and a porosity of up to 99.8%. The density of carbon aerogels can
          be as low as 0.16 mg/cm³, making them one of the lightest solid
          materials ever created.
