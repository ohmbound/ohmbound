          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          Photonic crystals are materials that have revolutionized the way we
          manipulate light. These periodic structures can control the flow of
          photons in a manner similar to how semiconductors control the flow of
          electrons. With applications spanning telecommunications,
          spectroscopy, and quantum computing, photonic crystals are at the
          forefront of modern optical technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          By leveraging the principles of light diffraction and interference,
          photonic crystals enable precise control over light propagation. Their
          unique properties make them invaluable in industries ranging from
          electronics to healthcare.

          What Are Photonic Crystals?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Photonic crystals are materials with a periodic arrangement of
          dielectric constants. This periodicity creates a photonic bandgapâ€”a
          range of wavelengths where light cannot propagate. The concept is
          analogous to electronic bandgaps in semiconductors, which prevent
          certain energy levels of electrons from being occupied.
        </p>
        <p>
          These materials can be classified into three categories based on their
          dimensionality:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>1D Photonic Crystals:</strong> These consist of alternating
            layers of materials with different refractive indices. Common
            examples include Bragg mirrors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2D Photonic Crystals:</strong> These feature a periodic
            arrangement in two dimensions, often used in optical fibers and
            integrated circuits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3D Photonic Crystals:</strong> These are periodic in all
            three dimensions and are used in more advanced applications like
            photonic bandgap lasers.
          </li>
        </ul>

          How Photonic Crystals Work
        </h2>
        <p>
          The key principle behind photonic crystals is their ability to
          manipulate light through constructive and destructive interference.
          When light interacts with the periodic structure, certain wavelengths
          are reflected, while others pass through or are absorbed. The
          photonic bandgap is the range of wavelengths that are completely
          blocked, preventing light from propagating in specific directions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The periodicity and refractive index contrast within the material
          determine the position and width of the photonic bandgap. By
          fine-tuning these parameters, researchers can engineer photonic
          crystals for specific applications, such as waveguides, resonators,
          and filters.
