          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          Piezoelectric materials are at the forefront of sustainable energy
          solutions, enabling the transformation of mechanical energy into
          electrical energy. This unique property has opened up a wide range of
          applications, from powering small electronic devices to creating
          self-sustaining systems in industrial and medical fields. With the
          global push toward renewable and efficient energy sources,
          piezoelectric materials have become a focal point of research and
          innovation.

          What Are Piezoelectric Materials?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Piezoelectric materials generate an electric charge in response to
          applied mechanical stress. This phenomenon, known as the
          piezoelectric effect, occurs in materials with specific crystalline
          structures that lack a center of symmetry. When these materials are
          subjected to mechanical forces like compression, tension, or
          vibration, the internal distribution of positive and negative charges
          shifts, creating an electric field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common piezoelectric materials include natural substances like quartz
          and Rochelle salt, as well as synthetic ceramics such as lead
          zirconate titanate (PZT) and barium titanate. Modern advancements
          have also introduced polymer-based piezoelectric materials like
          polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which offer greater flexibility and
          adaptability for specific applications.

          style={{
            fontSize: "1.8rem",

          How Do Piezoelectric Materials Work?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The piezoelectric effect involves two main mechanisms: the direct
          effect and the converse effect. The direct effect refers to the
          generation of an electric charge when the material is mechanically
          stressed. The converse effect, on the other hand, is the mechanical
          deformation of the material when an electric field is applied.
        </p>
        <p>
          These properties make piezoelectric materials ideal for both sensing
          and actuation. For example, they can convert vibrations or pressure
          into electrical signals (as in sensors) or convert electrical energy
          into mechanical motion (as in actuators).
