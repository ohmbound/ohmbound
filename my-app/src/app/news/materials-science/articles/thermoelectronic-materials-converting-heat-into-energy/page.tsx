          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          Thermoelectric materials are at the forefront of energy innovation,
          offering the ability to convert heat into electrical energy and vice
          versa. This capability, known as the thermoelectric effect, has the
          potential to revolutionize energy efficiency by harvesting waste heat
          from various sources such as industrial processes, automotive
          exhausts, and even the human body. With increasing global energy
          demands and the need for sustainable solutions, thermoelectric
          materials provide a promising pathway toward reducing energy waste and

          What Are Thermoelectric Materials?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Thermoelectric materials are substances that can directly convert
          temperature differences into electrical voltage through the
          thermoelectric effect. This effect is governed by two primary
          phenomena:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Seebeck Effect:</strong> When a temperature gradient exists
            across a thermoelectric material, a voltage is generated. This
            property is used for power generation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Peltier Effect:</strong> When an electrical current is
            passed through a thermoelectric material, it creates a temperature
            gradient, leading to heating on one side and cooling on the other.
            This property is used for temperature control and refrigeration.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The efficiency of thermoelectric materials is determined by the
          dimensionless figure of merit (ZT), which depends on three key
          properties: electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and the
          Seebeck coefficient. Materials with high electrical conductivity and
          low thermal conductivity are ideal for thermoelectric applications.
